In this project I have compared top 10 brightest stars other than our Sun and I have also tried to use visible spectrum for seeing how many stars lie in IR region, visible region and UV region. By plotting this I can estimate the temperature of the star as we know that UV region will have more energy and more energy means we will have more temperature. And other than that I have taken data of top 8 oldest stars from our universe to see that right now where are thhey lying in the spectral region
